# Tabify

**Tabify** is a ChromeÂ® extension designed to make your new tab page more beautiful and inspiring. Every time you open a new tab, Tabify loads a stunning random image from [Picsum Photos](https://picsum.photos) as the background. Additionally, it displays a wise and thought-provoking quote fetched from [RealInspire API](https://api.realinspire.tech). To make it even more useful, Tabify shows the current date in both the Gregorian and Persian calendars.

## Features
